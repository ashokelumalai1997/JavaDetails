# JavaDetails

**Java 8 (March 2014):**

1. **Lambda Expressions**: Introduced lambda expressions to provide a concise way to express instances of single-method interfaces (functional interfaces).

2. **Stream API**: Introduced the Stream API for working with sequences of data in a functional style, enabling powerful operations like map, filter, and reduce.

3. **Default Methods**: Allowed interfaces to have method implementations, reducing the impact on implementing classes when interfaces evolve.

4. **Functional Interfaces**: Formalized the concept of functional interfaces and provided annotations like `@FunctionalInterface` for better code readability and safety.

5. **Method References**: Introduced method references as a shorthand notation to refer to methods by name.

6. **New Date and Time API**: Introduced the `java.time` package for modern date and time handling, including classes like `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, and `Instant`.

**Java 11 (September 2018):**

1. **Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters**: Allowed `var` to be used for the parameters of lambda expressions, enhancing code readability.

2. **HTTP Client (Standard)**: Introduced a new HTTP client API (`java.net.http`) to simplify making HTTP requests and handling responses.

3. **Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs**: Enabled running a Java program directly from a single source code file without explicit compilation.

4. **Nest-Based Access Control**: Introduced the concept of nestmates to provide a more secure and efficient access control mechanism.

**Java 17 (September 2021):**

1. **Pattern Matching (Preview Feature)**: Introduced pattern matching for the `instanceof` operator to simplify and enhance conditional code.

2. **Sealed Classes (Preview Feature)**: Allowed classes and interfaces to be sealed, specifying which classes are permitted to extend or implement them.

3. **Foreign Function and Memory API (Incubator)**: Introduced an incubating API for interacting with native code and memory in a more controlled and efficient manner.

4. **Strong Encapsulation of JDK Internals**: Enhanced encapsulation by further restricting access to internal APIs, promoting better modularization.

5. **Deprecation of Applet API**: Deprecated the Applet API, which was no longer considered secure or relevant.

6. **Foreign Function Interface (FFI) API**: Included a foreign function interface API for interacting with native code in a more efficient and structured manner.
